# Abstract

"To live in peace one must be blind, deaf, and mute". Although worldwide nations have continuously increased their military expenditure over time to enhance their security, we are still living in the world with complex and diverse threats. One of the promising ways to prevent and overcome the threats is multinational cooperation. In our narrative storytelling, we show the existing threat in the real world and emphasize the importance of multinational cooperation. To this end, we visualized the correlation between GDP and military expenditure, the number of military disputes over the world, and the comparison between the military expenditure of alliance/disputed countries. For evaluation, we used TeamViewer to observe user behavior, such as how long users stay on which page, and collected feedback through questionnaires.
