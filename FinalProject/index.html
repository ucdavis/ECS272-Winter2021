        ['Washington','<strong>Washington</strong><br><br>Gov. Jay Inslee on Feb. 25 announced a temporary pause to any region in his "Healthy Washington" plan returning to the first phase and tighter restrictions, keeping eight regions in the plan\'s Phase 2. The plan allows regions to reopen when they meet certain hospitalization and case metrics. The entire state is now in Phase 2, which allows restaurants to resume indoor service at 25% capacity up until 11 p.m., but bars that serve only alcohol must stay closed. Indoor fitness centers and entertainment venues can also also open at 25% capacity.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 23, 2020; ended on May 4, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Oregon','<strong>Oregon</strong><br><br>Some counties will stay in Oregon\'s "high-risk" category for COVID-19 restrictions next week, even if data show they should move back to "extreme risk." Gov. Kate Brown has changed the process for counties facing moves back to "extreme risk" to allow a two-week extension, her office said March 4. "High risk" means indoor dining is allowed with reduced occupancy; inside visitation are allowed at long-term care facilities; and occupancy limits were expanded at churches, indoor fitness and entertainment venues. Brown allowed limited opening of gyms and other facilities offering indoor activities in counties considered at extreme risk of COVID-19 spread, beginning Jan. 29. Oregon relaxed guidelines for school reopenings on Jan. 19.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 23, 2020</strong>'],
        ['California','<strong>California</strong><br><br>Seven more counties joined those eligible to open indoor operations at restaurant dining rooms, gyms, movie theaters, museums, zoos, and aquariums March 2. Gov. Gavin Newsom\'s office on Feb. 6 issued revised guidelines for indoor church services after the Supreme Court lifted the state\'s ban on indoor worship during the coronavirus pandemic, but left in place restrictions on singing and chanting. Newsom announced the lifting of the stay-at-home order for all of the state\'s regions. Restaurants can resume outdoor dining and hair salons and libraries can reopen with restrictions.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 19, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Idaho','<strong>Idaho</strong><br><br>Gov. Brad Little announced a return to Stage 3 on Feb. 2, allowing indoor gatherings of 50 people or fewer and outdoor gatherings at 25% capacity. Idaho schools began allowing two fans per athlete into high school sporting events. The state had previously moved back to Stage 3 of reopening and reimposed restrictions including gathering restrictions and stricter rules for bars and restaurants, after being in the fourth and final phase for months.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 25, 2020; ended on April 30, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Nevada','<strong>Nevada</strong><br><br>Starting Feb. 15, Nevada\'s capacity limits increased for many public spaces. Libraries, museums, art galleries, aquariums and zoos moved to 50 percent capacity. Indoor dining at restaurants and bars are capped at 35% capacity, and will increase to 50% March 15. Sisolak strengthened Nevada\'s mask mandate by requiring people to wear a face covering during private gatherings indoors and outdoors, and when around people who are not part of the immediate household.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 31, 2020; ended on May 15, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Utah','<strong>Utah</strong><br><br>Gov. Spencer Cox predicted gatherings without masks will be allowed by July, but said in early March that he does not want to lift all restrictions until more residents are vaccinated. High school sports were allowed to continue in December with restrictions. Former Gov. Gary Herbert on Nov. 23 lifted restrictions on social gatherings despite continued high rates of COVID-19 transmission and hospitalizations. Herbert had previously introduced a new tiered "Transmission Index" that will be used to place each Utah county into one of three levels of alert.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Never issued</strong>'],
        ['Arizona','<strong>Arizona</strong><br><br>Gov. Doug Ducey has ordered that all schools must return to in-person learning this month, saying "students need to be back in the classroom." Ducey previously relaxed regulations on restaurants to encourage a shift from indoor to outdoor dining. And he declared that businesses that repeatedly disregard safety guidelines would face closure. The governor did not implement a statewide curfew or a shutdown or put a stop to athletic events â€“ all measures recommended by public health researchers and medical providers. He also did not put in place a statewide mask mandate.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 30, 2020; ended on May 15, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Montana','<strong>Montana</strong><br><br>Gov. Greg Gianforte said he will lift the statewide mask mandate put in place by his predecessor Steve Bullock on Feb. 12. Gianforte on Jan. 15 removed health mandates issued by Bullock, saying the restrictions are harmful to the state\'s businesses. Restaurants, bars, breweries, distilleries and casinos are no longer subject to a 10 p.m. curfew. Gianforte also removed capacity limits for businesses: under Bullock, those venues were limited to 50% capacity.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 26, 2020; ended on April 24, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Wyoming','<strong>Wyoming</strong><br><br>Gov. Mark Gordon will lift Wyoming\'s mask mandate March 16, and will "resume normal operations" for bars, restaurants, theaters and gyms. The mask requirement has been in place since early December. Starting March 1, Wyoming lifted all restrictions on personal care businesses. Gordon on Feb. 15 had extended Wyoming\'s face mask requirement, but loosened restrictions on restaurants, gyms and public gatherings. He lifted public health orders that required Wyoming bars and restaurants to close at 10 p.m. on Jan. 9, and gyms could increase capacity from 10 to 25 people.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Never issued</strong>'],
        ['Colorado','<strong>Colorado</strong><br><br>Gov. Jared Polis and state health department Executive Director Jill Hunsaker Ryan released new metrics that will allow more counties to move into less-restrictive levels and make it easier for counties to move between restriction levels. Many counties eased into a less restrictive set of rules Jan. 4, reopening restaurants to limited indoor dining and once again allowing small personal gatherings. Businesses certified in the state\'s 5-Star â€” or Level Up â€” program can operate under Level Blue restrictions, regardless of what level their county is operating under, if 70% of those age 70 and older have received at least one vaccine. Level Blue restrictions allow for greater capacity in restaurants, gyms, retail and other businesses.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 26, 2020; ended on May 8, 2020</strong>'],
        ['New Mexico','<strong>New Mexico</strong><br><br>New Mexico loosened some public health restrictions on business and public activities Feb. 24, adjusting the state\'s framework of public health orders based on county-level prevalence of COVID-19 and test positivity. Additionally, the state has added a color to its red-yellow-green scheme measuring county-level transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a step Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had predicted in her most recent news conference on the pandemic response. The new Turquoise level will indicate the lowest level of restrictions on business activity and gathering. More school districts in New Mexico could bring students back to classrooms in early February. New Mexico also now allows college teams to practice in New Mexico as long as they are following testing protocols.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 24, 2020; ended on May 15, 2020</strong>'],
        ['North Dakota','<strong>North Dakota</strong><br><br>North Dakota\'s mask mandate expired Jan. 18. Starting Jan. 8, restaurants, bars and event venues were allowed to operate at 65% capacity, not to exceed 200 people. Banquet, ballroom and event venues, which have been limited to 25% capacity, will be able to start operating at 50%. Borgum on Nov. 14 had mandated the wearing of masks in businesses and indoor spaces in their states, following increased pressure from doctors, nurses and other health care professionals.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Never issued</strong>'],
        ['South Dakota','<strong>South Dakota</strong><br><br>Gov. Kristi Noem has repeatedly said she won\'t issue a statewide mask requirement and has voiced doubts about health experts who say face coverings prevent infections from spreading. Noem\'s "Back to Normal Plan" lays out actions for residents, employers, schools and health care providers once four criteria categories are met, including a downward trajectory of documented coronavirus cases for 14 days in an area with sustained community spread.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Never issued</strong>'],
        ['Nebraska','<strong>Nebraska</strong><br><br>On Jan. 30, Nebraska moved from the "blue" to "green phase," increasing capacity for indoor gatherings, including youth extracurricular activities, from 75% to 100%. The state had been in "blue" since Dec. 24.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Never issued</strong>'],
        ['Kansas','<strong>Kansas</strong><br><br>The Kansas State Department of Education now recommends the state\'s school districts allow middle and high school students to return to five-day-a-week, in-person classes â€” if certain health precautions are followed. Gov. Laura Kelly extended the expiration date of Kansas\' COVID-19 emergency declaration to March 31. Of note, however, will be new, more permanent restrictions on the Democratic governor\'s emergency powers by the majority-GOP Legislature. Kelly won\'t be able to issue any emergency orders shutting down businesses or limiting gatherings.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 30, 2020; ended on May 3, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Oklahoma','<strong>Oklahoma</strong><br><br>Gov. Kevin Stitt extended a state of emergency order, but lifted a nighly 11 p.m. curfew in place for bars and restaurants. In December, he detailed new limits on public gatherings and indoor sporting events. Gatherings such as weddings, funerals and parties are limited to 50% capacity. Attendance at indoor youth sporting is limited to four spectators per participant or 50% of building capacity.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Never issued</strong>'],
        ['Texas','<strong>Texas</strong><br><br>Gov. Greg Abbott said March 2 it\'s time to "open Texas 100%" and end the statewide mask order, citing declining hospitalizations across the state as more people are vaccinated against the coronavirus. Abbott issued a new executive order, which will take effect March 10 and rescind most of his earlier orders, including restrictions on business occupancy and the July 2 statewide mask order. In some hospital regions, restaurants and private businesses have been required to reduce capacity from 75% to 50%, and any bars that were allowed to open under previous guidance from Abbott were required to close.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started April 2, 2020; ended on April 30, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Minnesota','<strong>Minnesota</strong><br><br>Gov. Tim Walz eased indoor crowd restrictions starting Feb. 13. Wedding receptions and private indoor gatherings can increase to 50 people or 25% capacity. Restaurants can host up to 250 people but must operate at no more than 50% capacity. Restaurants can also remain open until 11 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. Bars, restaurants and other venues were reopened with restrictions on Jan. 11. Every elementary school in the state could choose to operate in person beginning Jan. 18 if they are able to implement strategies such as requiring staff to wear face shields and offering regular testing. Group classes could resume Jan. 4, as well as youth and adult sport practices. Outdoor entertainment venues can open at 25% capacity.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 27, 2020; ended on May 4, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Iowa','<strong>Iowa</strong><br><br>Gov. Kim Reynolds lifted the state\'s limited mask requirement Feb. 7, along with the social distancing requirements and other COVID-19 mitigation measures she had in place for businesses and social gatherings. Reynolds signed a requirement Jan. 28 for Iowa schools to give parents the option to send their children to school five days a week. As of Jan. 7, Iowa high schools no longer have to limit the amount of fans in attendance at sporting events.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Never issued</strong>'],
        ['Missouri','<strong>Missouri</strong><br><br>Missouri senators on Feb. 10 began airing proposed legislation to limit the power of local officials to impose health orders. Republican state lawmakers unhappy with some of the restrictions cities and counties are imposing to fight COVID-19 are now looking to give themselves veto power. Gov. Mike Parson let his statewide social distancing order lapse June 9, leaving it to local governments to impose limits on public life amid the coronavirus outbreak. In areas without their own orders, the decision means social distancing requirements for restaurants and retailers will end and people will no longer be legally required to stay 6 feet apart from non-family members in public.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started April 6, 2020; ended on May 3, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Arkansas','<strong>Arkansas</strong><br><br>Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Feb. 26 said he is changing his public health directives to guidelines, meaning they will no longer be mandatory.

        ['Louisiana','<strong>Louisiana</strong><br><br>Louisiana bars can open and live indoor music will return for the first time in more than a year as Gov. John Bel Edwards loosens COVID-19 restrictions but leaves his statewide mask mandate in place.

Starting March 3, restaurants, gyms and other events could increase capacity.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 23, 2020; ended on May 14, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Wisconsin','<strong>Wisconsin</strong><br><br>Gov. Tony Evers on Feb. 4 issued a new health emergency order requiring face masks in public indoor places just an hour after Wisconsin Republican lawmakers eliminated the same mandate. Evers on Nov. 10 signed an executive order asking Wisconsin reidents to stay home and encouraging businesses to take additional steps to protect workers, customers, and the surrounding community.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 25, 2020; ended on May 26, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Illinois','<strong>Illinois</strong><br><br>All of Illinois moved into Phase 4 as of Feb. 4, the least-strict level before the economy is allowed to reopen completely. In Phase 4, indoor service at bars can resume, with an occupancy limit of 25% or 25 people, and only six people can be at a table at a time. Bars and restaurants must stop serving alcohol at 11 p.m., and must be closed by midnight under Phase 4 mitigations.

        ['Tennessee','<strong>Tennessee</strong><br><br>Tennessee lifted its state-specific visitation restrictions to long-term care facilities, effective Feb. 28. Gov. Bill Lee has added grandparents of athletes and teachers to the list of fans eligible to attend high school sports contests, including basketball and wrestling. A new executive order (No. 74) allows that game, school and facility administrators along with athletic officials can still attend games along with coaching and team personnel. Parents and guardians along with other immediate household members are also allowed to attend. The order also does away with a 10-person public gathering restriction in place since Dec. 20. Lee recommends county mayors enact mask mandates.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started April 2, 2020; ended on April 30, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Mississippi','<strong>Mississippi</strong><br><br>Gov. Tate Reeves signed a new executive order afternoon removing all mask mandates in Mississippi, deciding to instead encourage mask-wearing and other restrictions rather than mandating them. The order goes into effect at 5 p.m. March 3. The only rules that will remain in this order are a capacity limit of 50% on indoor arenas, and those that govern K-12 schools.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started April 3, 2020; ended on May 11, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Michigan','<strong>Michigan</strong><br><br>Restaurants can accept twice as many indoor diners, shops and businesses can also allow more customers and private gatherings may involve more people under a new state health order set to take effect March 5. The state will also ease mandates on nursing home visitors, allowing those who have received a negative COVID-19 test to visit their loved ones. Michigan began allowing indoor dining on a limited basis starting Feb. 1. Casinos, movie theaters, bowling alleys and similar venues were allowed to reopen Dec. 21, with some restrictions in place. High schools were allowed to resume in-person classes that week, as well.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 24, 2020; ended on June 5, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Indiiana','<strong>Indiiana</strong><br><br>An additional 22 Indiana counties will not face the state\'s county-level COVID-19 restrictions governing social gatherings, the state health department\'s latest map update shows. There are now 31 counties shaded blue on the state\'s advisory-level map as of March 3. The update means those blue counties will no longer face social gathering capacity restrictions, but they must obey social distancing and mask-wearing protocols. Counties in red or orange on the state\'s coronavirus dashboard website now have a 25% capacity limit on social gatherings. Gov. Eric Holcomb placed limits on social gatherings and school events for most of the state, and he also made available $20 million to local officials to help ensure businesses adhere to the state\'s mask and social distancing requirements.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 25, 2020; ended on May 1, 2020</strong>'],
        ['West Virginia','<strong>West Virginia</strong><br><br>Gov.

Indoor sporting events are also allowed to have crowds at 30 percent capacity with a maximum of 250 spectators under the new executive order. Indoor events currently have a 25-fan limit. Bars and taverns may also reopen. Gyms, museums, aquariums, barbers, retail establishments, restaurants, breweries and wineries may all operate at 50% capacity with safety protocols still in place. For restaurants, that keeps capacity stable. But a new executive order also relaxes restrictions on alcohol sales, moving the stop time for on-site beverage sales from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 30, 2020; ended on May 8, 2020</strong>'],
        ['Alabama','<strong>Alabama</strong><br><br>Gov. Kay Ivey on Jan. 21 extended a statewide mask mandate order through March 5 amid state struggles with COVID-19 and the delivery of vaccines.

        ['New York','<strong>New York</strong><br><br>New York state will soon relax limits on gatherings at homes as well as smaller arts, entertainment and sporting venues as coronavirus cases continued to decline, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said March 3. The new rules will allow event venues of under 10,000 patrons to reopen at up to 33% capacity, up to a maximum of 100 people indoors and 200 people outdoors.

        ['Ohio','<strong>Ohio</strong><br><br>Ohio officials are moving to relax COVID-19 safety restrictions to permit school proms, graduations, weddings, sports and other spring events to accommodate more people as hospitalizations decline and vaccinations increase. The state plans to soon announce guidelines for indoor venues to permit people at 25% of capacity while outdoor settings, such as sports stadiums, will be allowed to admit crowds of 30% of capacity. Bar and restaurant owners are looking forward to serving customers late at night again after a statewide 11 p.m. curfew expired Feb. 11.<br><br><strong>Stay-at-home order: Started March 23, 2020; ended on May 30, 2020</strong>'],

The orders vary by state, county and even city. Restrictions are ramping up in many areas as cases surge nationwide. At the height of restrictions in late March and early April, more than 310 million Americans were under directives ranging from "shelter in place" to "stay at home."',

                   'The line plot below plots the daily country average SO2 index. The shaded area demonstrates the 2018-2020 three year daily high and low SO2 index. We can clearly observe that the country average SO2 index is at three year low in the majority of days.',
                   'We can observe that, before California issued stay-at-home order March 9, 2020, the SO2 index stayed in the middle part of the three year range. However, after the stay-at-home order has been issued, the 2020\'s SO2 index quickly dropped and almost consistently stayed at the bottom all the way until October.  It\'s worth mentioning that California had its worst wild fire in history in 2020, which is probably the cause of the bad air quality after October.',
                   'We can better observe the impact of people staying at home on SO2 index with the "relative display mode". Which displays the relative difference of 2020\'s SO2 index and previous reference year\'s.',
                   'During the period of mid March (when most states issued stay-at-home order) and mid May (when most states lifted stay-at-home order), we can observe that most states were having better (average) SO2 index compare to the reference year of 2019. We can see that this remains true even for some states that didn\'t issue stay-at-home order, such as South Dakota, which probably indicate that people were consciously staying at home even without the state government issuing the order.',
