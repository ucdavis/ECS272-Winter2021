# Homework 3:  Visualization Dashboard Pt 2 (Interactivty)
This is a visualization for LAS Passenger Traffic By Terminal and I added a narrative plot as intro and ending. 

To start to navigate this mini narrative visualization, please open the index html first, and then follow the text description you can click “enter” or any areas on the board. Then you will navigate the main interactive data visualization dashboard. The main interactive data visualization also can be viewed by open vis.html. You can zoom and pan the streamgraph and experience the tween animation of the pie chart and the bar chart. Then you can click “back” button on the right top corner to back to the end of story. When you back to the main page, there is another option to start over the visualization by click “start over” on the board.

The screen resolution for this visualization is 1440*900.

Thank you!
