# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

First run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies. If you do not have npm please install both [Node.js and Npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.






Or, I have already built the React App and you can, in the build directory, run:

### `npm install -g serve`

### `serve -s build`

Finally you will be provided a localhost to view it in the browser.
